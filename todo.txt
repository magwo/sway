* Recursive random deterministic seed support, seeds determine tree looks deterministically
* Progressive tree generation from parameters: baseSize, slimness, straightness, stiffness, branchCount, colors
* Coloring

* Later: Withering/falling down (cycle of life)
* Later: Collision with objects
* Later: Polygon graphics for completely joined tree
* Later: Wind effects - general and from mouse movement
